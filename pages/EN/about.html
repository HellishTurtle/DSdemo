								<h2 class="title">&nbsp;About Dark Souls</h2>
								<p class="intro">&nbsp;Dark Souls takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran. Players assume the role of a cursed human character who has been chosen to make a pilgrimage out of the Undead Asylum to discover the fate of the undead. The plot of Dark Souls is primarily told through descriptions of in-game items and dialogue with non-playable characters (NPCs). Players must piece together what vague information they obtain in order to understand the story, rather than having it laid out for them by the game. Dark Souls garnered recognition due to its grueling difficulty and unforgiving challenge. The game world is filled with weapons, armor and consumable items that serve to assist the player throughout their journey.</p>

									<p style="text-align:start">&nbsp; You are undead, struggling to fight your way through the realms of Lordran on a quest whose final purpose is anything but clear. Where many games burden you with plot and background lore, Dark Souls lets the places you go tell their own kind of story, one lost in time and shrouded in mystery. The stone ruins at Firelink Shrine, the overrun town known as the Undead Burg, the vast marble halls of Anor Londo--these all speak of a once-prosperous realm rich with history, and rather than spelling it out in detail, Dark Souls lets you wonder about what has dragged this land into its current state of miserable disrepair. Item descriptions and brief conversations with non-player characters occasionally illuminate the smallest aspects of Lordran&#39;s past, and over time, you may piece together a reasonably fleshed-out picture of the crisis that has befallen the land. But you needn&#39;t concern yourself with these details if they don&#39;t interest you. The wondrous realms of Lordran are sure to seduce you whether you care to know their history or not.&nbsp;Darkroot Garden is so oppressively green that you can almost feel the air get warm and muggy around you. Running along the surreal shores of Ash Lake is like stepping into a dream. Locations like Anor Londo and the duke&#39;s archives fuse faded opulence with grand machinery in a way that&#39;s reminiscent of locations in the classic adventure game&nbsp; 
									Myst, and like the realms of that game, these places have a way of staying in your head even when you&#39;re not playing. Terrific sound design is a huge factor in Dark Souls&#39; ability to pull you in. Your steps echo convincingly in vast chambers. A heavy suit of armor clangs with every step you take. The strange noises a feared creature makes may send shivers up your spine before you even lay eyes on it.</p> 
									
								<p><img src="../../imagesDS/about1.jpg" /></p> 
									<p style="text-align:start">From almost your earliest steps in this dangerous world, you&#39;re beset by enemies, and you quickly learn to never let your guard down. Even the most common and clumsy enemies you encounter have attacks that can make short work of you if you&#39;re not careful. Melee combat is straightforward; there are no elaborate combos to learn, and Dark Souls certainly doesn&#39;t need them. With the small assortment of attacks, blocks, parries, and evasive maneuvers at your disposal, the combat in Dark Souls becomes a deadly dance in which each of your strikes that hits its target is a small victory and each potentially devastating attack from an enemy that you narrowly evade offers a new lease on life. Just be aware that poorly implemented mouse and keyboard support makes playing the game that way much too unwieldy; the game demands a controller.&nbsp;Each new area brings with it challenging new enemies, as varied and memorable in their designs as they are in their techniques. Huge knights slumber in a forest, slowly and menacingly getting to their feet when you draw near. In the painted world of Ariamis, foul abominations with repulsive toxic sacs around their heads threaten to poison you when you deliver the killing blow. And you won&#39;t soon forget the first time you&#39;re cursed by the big-eyed basilisks of the depths, as your body becomes covered in a crystalline growth and you freeze in a pained gesture as death takes you.&nbsp;There&#39;s a wide variety of weapons to acquire and use, with each type offering a different fighting style. (Some swords are for swinging, and others are for thrusting, for example.) There&#39;s also a good assortment of weapon enhancement options. As you progress and collect crafting items, you find that you can have a blacksmith make your weapons more powerful, and eventually imbue them with effects like lightning or fire. Finding a better weapon or making your existing weapon more powerful isn&#39;t just a matter of added convenience; it can be the difference between survival and failure. And if you prefer to keep your distance from foes, bows and a diverse assortment of magic spells can be very effective, though you still need to frequently tangle with enemies in intense, close-quarters battles.</p> 
									
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../../imagesDS/sanctuary_guardian.png" /></p> 
									<p>&nbsp;</p> 
									<p style="text-align:start">The stakes can be high as you venture through Dark Souls, making your determination to survive and persevere that much greater. As you vanquish enemies, you collect souls, which can be spent to level up your character, or to purchase items and services from the few blacksmiths and merchants eking out an existence in certain corners of the world. These souls are a precious commodity indeed, and should you fall in battle (and you will), your souls fall with you. However, all is not immediately lost. If, in your next life, you can make it back to the spot of your previous demise and touch your bloodstain, you regain the souls you had acquired. Perish again without recovering them, however, and they disappear forever. It&#39;s a crushing feeling to die, knowing that it means the permanent loss of a significant number of hard-earned souls, but it&#39;s precisely that danger that makes the struggle to stay alive so exciting.&nbsp;In each realm of Dark Souls, there are bonfires that offer your only real sanctuary from the constant dangers you face. It&#39;s only at these locations that you can spend souls to level up, and when you perish, you restart from the last bonfire at which you rested. Because they serve as checkpoints on your journey, happening upon one can bring with it a tremendous sense of relief, since you know you won&#39;t need to overcome the dangers you faced to get here again. That feeling of relief is short-lived though, because you must soon press on into the unknown dangers that lie ahead.</p> 
									
								<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../../imagesDS/nito.png" /></p> 
									<p style="text-align:start">The sense of trepidation that comes with forging on into unknown realms of Dark Souls doesn&#39;t subside after you&#39;ve played the game for an hour or 10 or 20. It is a sustained feeling that arises out of the fact that you rarely know what lies around the next corner, or if you do, you haven&#39;t yet managed to overcome the challenges that await you there. That feeling of dread finds tremendous release in those moments when you finally conquer the boss of an area, and in the discoveries of the many shortcuts that link Lordran&#39;s realms in often surprising ways and give you the liberty to bypass long stretches you&#39;ve conquered at least once.&nbsp;In fact, few games offer a sense of exploration and discovery as rich and rewarding as that of Dark Souls . There is no hand-holding here, no NPC companion or helpful sign telling you which way to go next. Your discoveries are yours alone, and that makes them all the more gratifying. That&#39;s not to say that there is no assistance available for the wandering warrior, though. Players can scrawl messages on the ground that serve as clues or warnings to other players. It&#39;s a wonderful system that serves to remind you, as do the fleeting, ghostly glimpses you occasionally catch of other adventurers fighting their own battles, that although you are solitary, you aren&#39;t alone in your struggles.&nbsp;Dark Souls is a shared experience in which each player must mostly fight his or her own battles. However, you can call on assistance in moments of need. Players can leave summon signs, and you can summon one or two of these players to your world to help you take on the boss of an area. (You can also leave your own summon sign, offering your assistance to other players.) These connections are fleeting--win or lose against the boss, players are promptly returned to their own worlds--but the impact they have on your journey can be tremendous. Not all connections with other players are benevolent, though. Under certain circumstances, other players can invade your world with the intention of seeking you out and defeating you. It&#39;s terrifying to be deep into a dangerous realm and get the notification that your world has been invaded. It&#39;s just another example of the ways in which Dark Souls keeps you constantly alert and a little afraid.</p>
